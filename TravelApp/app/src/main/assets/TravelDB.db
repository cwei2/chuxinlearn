A little expensive but a great view of the harbor and a great location in downtown Boston next to restaurants and activities. We took a taxi to the hotel which I would recommend or you could take a subway from the airport. I would never advise driving in downtown Boston. We rented a car from Enterprise in downtown which they brought to us the next day at 1/2 the price we could have rented at the airport. Parking is $45/day and traffic is awful. The service was excellent from the front desk to the bellmen. We only ate breakfast there as dining was a little expensive and we wanted to walk around a bit. Breakfast buffet was $30 but was excellent. The room was nice but had a small king which I call 'a New York king bed.' I understand they have concerts outside in the summer which would be nice.

The amenities are cheaper than you'll find elsewhere...the kleenex hurt my nose it's so cheap. My room was on an alley that had garbage pickup at 4am which woke me up.
